Question Label Formatter
This project is a machine learning-based classifier that standardizes raw question labels (such as "Q2", "3-a-i", or "The answer is below") into a canonical format (like "2", "3(a)(i)", or "no_label"). It uses an SVM model with TF-IDF vectorization to recognize and classify text-based label variations.
